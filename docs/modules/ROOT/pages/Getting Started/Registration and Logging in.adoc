= Registration and Logging in

Using the Payara Cloud environment requires a user account that is linked to a _Subscription_. A _Subscription_ is a unit for billing purposes. For the product launch, Payara Cloud allows a single user account to access your subscription. A future feature will allow you to add multiple users with different access levels to your account.
